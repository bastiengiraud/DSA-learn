# DSA-learn.jl
This repository provides tools to generate datasets for dynamic security assessment using our proposed method and baseline benchmarks. Below is a guide to help you navigate the repository and generate your own dataset.

For more information, read our paper 'A Dataset Generation Toolbox for Dynamic Security Assessment: On the Role of the Security Boundary'. If you use this work, please cite it as follows:

## Setting up the Environment

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bastiengiraud/DSA-learn.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. **Acivate the Julia Environment**  
   In the Julia REPL, activate the environment (this is included in the main file!):

  ```bash
  using Pkg
  Pkg.activate(".")
  ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
  Install the required dependencies (this is also included in the main file!):

  ```bash
  using Pkg
  Pkg.instantiate()
  ```

4. **Install R**
  This repository also uses R and calls it using Rcall in Julia. Therefore, make sure you have R installed on your device.
  Moreover, you will need to install the following two packages in R: Rcpp, and volesti. You can install them as follows:

  - Open R terminal and type: 
    - install.packages("Rcpp")
    - install.packages("volesti")


## How to Use

To start using the toolbox, you simply need to specify your dataset parameters in the `init.jl` file, and then you can run the `main.jl` file. 

1. **Configure Parameters**:  
   All parameters required for dataset generation are specified in `init.jl`. This includes configurations for both the proposed method and the benchmark methods.

2. **Run the Main Script**:  
   The main script is `main.jl`. Execute this file to generate your dataset.

3. **Generate Benchmark Datasets**:  
   To generate datasets using one of the baseline benchmarks, execute the corresponding code in the `baseline` folder.

## Repository Structure

Hereâ€™s an overview of where to find everything in this repository:

- **Julia Packages**:  
  The required Julia packages and their specific versions are listed in `functions/env.jl`.

- **Toolbox Functions**:  
  All functions used throughout the toolbox are located in the `functions` folder.

- **Case and Generator Data**:  
  Case data and generator parameters are stored in the `cases` folder.

- **Baseline Benchmarks**:  
  The benchmarks used for comparison with the proposed method are found in the `baseline` folder.

- **Dependencies and Environments**:  
  Use the `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` files to import all necessary packages and their dependencies.
