# DSA-learn.jl
This repository provides tools to generate datasets for dynamic security assessment using our proposed method and baseline benchmarks. Below is a guide to help you navigate the repository and generate your own dataset.

For more information, read our paper 'A Dataset Generation Toolbox for Dynamic Security Assessment: On the Role of the Security Boundary'. If you use this work, please cite it as follows:

## Setting up the Environment

To get started with this repository, you simply need to clone the repository. All the dependencies are located in the Manifest.toml and project.toml files. All the dependencies will be installed on your machine when you run the main.jl file. For an additional overview of the packages used and their versions, you can go to functions/env.jl. But now, you can get started by:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bastiengiraud/DSA-learn.git
   ```

2. **Install R**
  This repository also uses R and calls it using Rcall in Julia. Therefore, make sure you have R installed on your device.
  Moreover, you will need to install the following two packages in R: Rcpp, and volesti. You can install them as follows:

  - Open a terminal in R and simply type: 
    - install.packages("Rcpp")
    - install.packages("volesti")


## How to Use

To start using the toolbox, you simply need to specify your dataset parameters in the `init.jl` file, and then you can run the `main.jl` file. The `init.jl` file contains ALL parameters you can modify. Behind the parameters, a short explanation is provided of what it is and what you can choose from.

1. **Configure Parameters**:  
   All parameters required for dataset generation are specified in `init.jl`. This includes configurations for both the proposed method and the benchmark methods.

2. **Run the Main Script**:  
   The main script is `main.jl`. Execute this file to generate your dataset.

3. **Generate Benchmark Datasets**:  
   To generate datasets using one of the baseline benchmarks, execute the corresponding code in the `baseline` folder.

## Repository Structure

Hereâ€™s an overview of where to find everything in this repository:

- **Julia Packages**:  
  The required Julia packages and their specific versions are listed in `functions/env.jl`.

- **Toolbox Functions**:  
  All functions used throughout the toolbox are located in the `functions` folder.

- **Case and Generator Data**:  
  Case data and generator parameters are stored in the `cases` folder.

- **Baseline Benchmarks**:  
  The benchmarks used for comparison with the proposed method are found in the `baseline` folder.

- **Dependencies and Environments**:  
  Use the `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` files to import all necessary packages and their dependencies.
